            <p>We experimented with the efficiency of LLMs in brainstorming new interesting angles or ideas for follow-up stories. For this assignment, we focused on creating specific steps or a narrative that will be the baseline we’ll use to test on each LLMS. Initially, for this assignment, we tested these steps on one LLM (ChatGPT), recorded a scenario, and evaluated each response we got from ChatGPT following each step.</p>

            <h2>Specific Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Determine the story you want to generate a follow-up idea for.</strong><br>
                <em>You need to determine the story first to set up the scope or areas of ideas you want LLMs to explore, and prevent responses that may be too general.</em><br><br>
                <strong>2. Upload the original story and ask LLMs to give you a summary of the story.</strong><br>
                <em>Asking LLMs to summarize the story is a way to test and make sure they actually read the original story and understand its context.</em><br><br>
                <strong>3. Tell the LLMs about the context of the task you want them to perform. For example, you could input this prompt: “I’m looking for a hard-news angle to follow up on the story I’ve just given you.”</strong><br>
                <em>Giving LLMs the context, like what types of angles you want them to come up with, could help narrow down the pool of ideas they would give you. Using the word “news” in the prompt would help LLMs understand that you want specific ideas that contain the newsworthy elements, not just general ideas.</em><br><br>
                <strong>4. Ask for follow-up ideas from the perspective of a position on the news staff. For example, you could use a prompt like: “Give me follow-up ideas from the perspective of a sports editor.”</strong><br>
                <em>This kind of specification in the prompt will help LLMs be aware that they have authority over the topic they’re asked to provide. It helps their answers be more on-topic and on-theme.</em><br><br>
                <strong>5. Ask for creative or weird follow-up ideas.</strong><br>
                <em>Sometimes, LLMs’ responses could get stuck in a rut of the same types of ideas that don’t illustrate much creativity. You could use this step to urge them to give different ideas that are more ambitious or provocative.</em><br><br>
                <strong>6. Ask LLMs to explain why each idea it generates is relevant or good.</strong><br>
                <em>By asking the LLM to reflect on why its ideas are valuable, the user can get a better understanding of how the LLM generates ideas and using that knowledge, write better prompts in the future.</em><br><br>
                <strong>7. Narrow the list of ideas LLMs gave down to the ideas you’re mainly interested in, maybe one or two ideas.</strong><br>
                <em>This keeps the conversation simpler and lets the LLM hone in on specific ideas more deeply, rather than providing surface-level advice.</em><br><br>
                <strong>8. Ask LLMs for potential pitfalls for each idea you selected, or why they might be bad</strong><br>
                <em>AI is more easily self-reflective than most humans, which means it’s good at spotting places you could run into reporting errors or ethical problems in a story idea. Even asking for critiques on an idea you’ve come up with yourself is helpful, as we’re less objective than LLMs.</em><br><br>
                <strong>9. Ask for the LLM to find similar stories on the internet to the ideas it proposed.</strong><br>
                <em>This will let the user find where the LLM got its idea, make sure the ideas aren’t redundant, and find inspiration for how to put the story together.</em><br><br>
                <strong>10. Ask LLMs to critique the pitch like an editor.</strong><br>
                <em>This is similar to the pitfalls, but adding the editor angle, as described in number four, gives you more pointed feedback.</em><br><br>

            <h2>Scenario and Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                We’re using Chat GPT and completing this from the perspective of reporters looking to follow up on this story: 
                <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/04/17/easter-egg-alternatives-dyed-potatoes-jello/" target="_blank">Washington Post: Easter Egg Alternatives</a><br><br>

                Here’s a link to our conversation, but we’ll walk you through it: 
                <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68031712-1520-8010-834b-e06b6a298bc0" target="_blank">ChatGPT Conversation</a><br><br>

                1. When we uploaded a story about easter egg alternatives to ChatGPT, we wanted to make sure first that ChatGPT had actually read the article. Hence, we had it summarize the story, and as it could give us all the key points in this article accurately, we were sure that ChatGPT had read this article and was ready to proceed with other steps.<br><br>  
                <div class="illustration-container">
                    <img src="insert_pic1.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration">
                </div>
                <div class="illustration-container2">
                    <img src="insert_pic2.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration2">
                </div>
                2. Next, we provided context that we were looking for entertaining angles to follow up on that story, and prompted ChatGPT to give follow-up story ideas from the perspective of a lifestyle editor. ChatGPT produced six ideas that were quite inapplicable.<br><br> 
                
                Some of them seemed out of the scope of what we expected to be valid ideas or even sounded frivolous, such as inviting readers to share their ideas of unconventional dyed Easter eggs or what other household items that you can dye, while some of them seemed to be redundant to the issues that the original story had already covered, such as exploring why some alternative dyed eggs failed.<br><br>
                <div class="illustration-container3">
                    <img src="insert_pic3.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration3">
                </div>
                We inferred that words like “entertaining” or “lifestyle” are attributed to this sort of response. We may fix this issue by giving ChatGPT more context of what kind of use case of the ideas we are asking for, for example, tell it we want to use this idea to write a feature story for the newsroom.<br><br>  
                <div class="illustration-container4">
                    <img src="insert_pic4.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration4">
                </div>
                3. As we had not gotten a usable idea yet, we told ChatGPT that the ideas it gave were redundant and asked for ones that were different from what was already in the article.<br><br> 
                <div class="illustration-container5">
                    <img src="insert_pic5.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration5">
                </div>
                ChatGPT still gave a bunch of unapplicable suggestions, but also one we considered a good idea, looking at the history of Easter eggs and egg hunts, and why they’ve stuck around. This is an idea that is plausible for a feature story for the actual newsroom, so we picked this one.<br><br> 
                <div class="illustration-container7">
                    <img src="insert_pic7.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration7">
                </div>
                4. Then, we asked ChatGPT to reflect why the idea we selected was good or relevant. In its response, we somewhat disagreed with its rationale. However, it showed that the LLM was looking at it from an angle of entertainment, rather than news, as we framed it to be in the previous prompt, and that was a good thing to be aware of.<br><br> 
                <div class="illustration-container8">
                    <img src="insert_pic8.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration8">
                </div>
                <div class="illustration-container9">
                    <img src="insert_pic9.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration9">
                </div>
                5. We also asked ChatGPT for the potential pitfalls it saw for covering this story from the perspective of an editor listening to the story. The concerns it posed were pretty solid and worth keeping in mind. It suggested that covering this angle could be too academic and dry, with no real takeaway to alienate readers by blurring religious lines in the piece. This could be an important consideration for someone planning to report on the story.<br><br> 
                <div class="illustration-container10">
                    <img src="insert_pic10.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration10">
                </div>
                <div class="illustration-container11">
                    <img src="insert_pic11.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration11">
                </div>
                <div class="illustration-container12">
                    <img src="insert_pic12.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration12">
                </div>
                6. For the last prompt, we asked ChatGPT to search for similar stories that may cover this same idea and critique this pitch again, as it was an editor from a real newsroom.<br><br> 
                <div class="illustration-container13">
                    <img src="insert_pic13.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration13">
                </div>
                <div class="illustration-container14">
                    <img src="insert_pic14.jpg" alt="ChatGPT summarizing Easter Egg article" class="illustration14">
                </div>
                This prompt confused the LLM and didn’t get what we wanted. However, it did provide more pointed concerns about the potential follow-up story from the vantage point of an editor.<br><br>
